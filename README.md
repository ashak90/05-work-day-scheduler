# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

In this assignment we were tasked with creating a scheduler for the workday that indicates the current date at the top and where the user can add events for each hour of the day and save these events to local storage. Also this scheduler indicates by color, whether the time was in the past or is in the present or future. For fun, I also added the time in seconds for the users convenience.

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
